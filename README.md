# miRNA_DE_Analysis

In this repository microarray miRNA differential expression analysis is conducted applying two different workflows:
- WF01: using limma and oligo from Bioconductor. 
- WF02: using samr from Bioconductor. 

The microarray dataset used to conduct the workflow was published by Dahlman et al. (2017) and is available at GEO with accesion number GSE87379.
