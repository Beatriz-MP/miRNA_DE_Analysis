# File contains all miRNAs from miRBase that have mapping information grouped by organism, all miRNAs without mapping information grouped by organism (designated as Sequence Type: miRNA), all sno/sca from UCSC (snoRNABase) and Ensembl (designated as Sequence Type: CDBox, HAcaBox, snoRNA and scaRna, and controls).
# miRNAs:
# * An annot name generally represents one genome location, but may refer to multiple annotations because of multiple mature products delineated by &quot;-3p&quot; and &quot;-5p&quot;, or &quot;.1&quot; and &quot;.2&quot;.
# * Also, those with a '-star' are minor products, and those without '-star' or any other aforementioned suffix are considered the major product.
# * Probeset IDs may appear more than once because the miRNA was mapped to multiple locations in the genome, and the annot names may have a &quot;-1&quot;, &quot;-2&quot;, etc type of suffix.
# * Probeset IDs with a letter suffix (eg, fru-miR-23a and fru-miR-23b) are related miRNAs where the sequence is highly similar.
# sno/sca:
# * The sequences for the sno/sca probesets are the entire sequences sent to Chip Design, not just the SIF regions.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Patients came to the laboratory for clinical examination following an overnight fast. An abdominal subcutaneous fat biopsy was obtained by needle biopsy. Tissue pieces were rapidly rinsed in saline. A small part was immediately used for determination of mean fat cell volume and for ex vivo quantification of adipocyte lipogenesis. The rest was frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C for subsequenct RNA preparation.

    <Summary>
The aim of this study was to detect and functionally investigate miRNAs linked to insulin sensitivity in human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT). Subjects were selected based on the insulin-stimulated lipogenesis response of subcutaneous adipocytes.
Eleven miRNAs displayed differential expression between OIR and OIS states. Overexpression of miR-143-3p and miR-652-3p increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis in human in vitro-differentiated adipocytes. MicroRNAs-143-3p and -652-3p are linked to scWAT insulin resistance independently of obesity.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Global miRNA profiling by array was performed in abdominal scWAT of obese insulin resistance (OIR), obese insulin sensitive (OIS) and lean women. Signicance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was use to compare the difference in gene expression between groups.MicroRNAs demonstrating differential expression between OIR and OIS women were overexpressed in human in vitro-differentiated adipocytes followed by assessment of lipogenesis and identification of miRNA targets by measuring mRNA/protein expression and 3’UTR analysis.
